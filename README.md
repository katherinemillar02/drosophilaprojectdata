# Effects of Diet on Lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster*

## Project Aims

This was a Genetics Society funded internship hosted by the Professor Tracey Chapman lab at University of East Anglia (UEA) Summer 2022. 

The aim of this project was to investigate the effect of altered protein:carbohydrate ratios in adult diets on lifespan in male and female *Drosophila melanogaster*.
