# Effects of Diet on Lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster*

## Project Aims

<img title="droso pic" alt="drosopAlt text" src="/images/flypic.jpg" width=200 height=100>

This was a Genetics Society funded internship hosted by the Professor Tracey Chapman lab at University of East Anglia (UEA) Summer 2022. 

 
The aim of this project was to investigate the effect of altered protein:carbohydrate (P:C) ratios in adult diets on lifespan in male and female *Drosophila melanogaster*.


This projected investigated the divergent diet choices of *drosophila melanogaster*, and looked at  how males chose compared to females, how mated females chose compared to virgin females, and also if choice differed if females were placed in plates with males versus if they were in plates alone. 

The four diets contain a variety of P:C ratios based on what has been found that is best for lifespan and reproductive success through previous research. The P:C diets chosen in these experiments were:  
8:1, 2:1, 1:2, 1:8.

#### "Experiment1.R"
##### Experiment 1 Feeding behaviour 
This script contains data analysis and data visualisation of experiment 1. Experiment 1
shows the feeding behaviour of mated male flies compared with the feeding behaviour of mated female flies. Data was collected over the course of 2 days, and all flies were given the choice of 4x altered P:C ratios in a choice "patch preference assay" (Churchill et al).

##### Experiment 2a Oviposition behaviour
This experiment also looks into diet choice of where the different types of females chose to lay the eggs.
