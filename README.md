# Effects of Diet on Lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster*

## Project Aims

<img title="droso pic" alt="drosopAlt text" src="/images/flypic.jpg" width=200 height=100>

This was a Genetics Society funded internship hosted by the Professor Tracey Chapman lab at University of East Anglia (UEA) Summer 2022. 

The aim of this project was to investigate the effect of altered protein:carbohydrate ratios in adult diets on lifespan in male and female *Drosophila melanogaster*. 

This projected investigated the divergent diet choices of *drosophila melanogaster*, and looked at  how males chose compared to females, how mated females chose compared to virgin females, and also if choice differed if females were placed in plates with males versus if they were in plates alone. 

The four diets contain a variety of P:C ratios based on what has been found that is best for lifespan and reproductive success through previous research. The P:C diets chosen in these experiments were:  
8:1, 2:1, 1:2, 1:8.

*Figure: Mated female feeding behaviour shown in an experimental petri dish. The top of the petri dish shows diet ratios from (left to right) 8:1 and 2:1, and the bottom of the dish shows P:C ratios 1:2 and 1:8. Mated females are shown to mainly feed on the 8:1 diet.*

### Data analysis, including data visualisation and statistical tests for the different experiments. 

#### Experiment 1 
An experiment looking at the feeding behaviour of mated males compared with the feeding behaviour of mated females over the course of 2 days when given the choice of 4x altered P:C ratios. 
This experiment also looks into diet choice of where females chose to lay the eggs. 

#### Experiment 2a
An experiment looking at the feeding behaviour of mated females compared with the feeding behaviour of virgin females over the course of 3 days, when given the choice of 4x altered P:C ratios. 
This experiment also looks into diet choice of where the different types of females chose to lay the eggs. 

#### Experiment 2b
A repear of the experiment looking at the feeding behaviour of mated females compared with the feeding behaviour of virgin females, completed over the course of 2 days, when given the choice of 4x altered P:C ratios. 
This experiment also looks into diet choice of where the different types of females chose to lay the eggs.

#### Experiment 3
An experiment looking at the feeding behaviour of n=10 females on a replicate of plates compared with n=5 females mixed with n=5 males on a plate. Feeding behaviour is monitored from 4x different P:C ratios. 
This experiment also includes analysis of the offspring produced from egg laying on the 4x different P:C ratios.
