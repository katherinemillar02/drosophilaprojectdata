There was a strong significant difference when looking at the
interaction effect between diet choice and male and female sex (F =
30.5, P = \textless0.001 ), so this was kept in the model.

There was a significant difference (P = 0.02) found between the diets
that females chose to feed on and the diets that males chose to feed on.
With the 2:1 diet being the most popular diets for females to feed on
with having a mean average of 2.72 flies on a feeding patch at one
observation taken over 2 days of observations. While the most popular
feeding diet for males was 1:8 with there being a mean average of 1.06
flies on a patch at an observation.

There was a large significant difference (P=\textless0.001) found
between females choosing a 1:2 diet (a diet higher in carbohydrate),
than males choosing a 2:1 diet (a diet high in protein).
