## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots



There was a strong significant difference when looking at the interaction effect between diet choice and male and female sex (F = 30.5, P = <0.001 ), so this was kept in the model. 

There was a significant difference (P = 0.02) found between the diets that females chose to feed on and the diets that males chose to feed on. With the 2:1 diet being the most popular diets for females to feed on with having a mean average of 2.72 flies on a feeding patch at one observation taken over 2 days of observations. While the most popular feeding diet for males was 1:8 with there being a mean average of 1.06 flies on a patch at an observation. 

There was a large significant difference (P=<0.001) found between females choosing a 1:2 diet (a diet higher in carbohydrate), than males choosing a 2:1 diet (a diet high in protein). 






You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
