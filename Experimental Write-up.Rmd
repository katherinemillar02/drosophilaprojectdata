A generalised linear model was used with quasipoisson to count for overdispersion. Day was dropped from the model as there was found to be no significant effect of including day in the model (P = 0.32). 
It was found that there was a strong significant effect in diet choice when comparing mated *drosophila melanogaster* with virgin. When comparing the P:C 8:1 diet to mated and virgin flies, there was a signficant difference found (P = <0.0001), there was a mean average of 2.74 flies on the 8:1 diet per observation while there was a mean average of only 1.64 flies on a patch at an observation for the virgin females.
